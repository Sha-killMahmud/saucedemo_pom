# The pytest-dependency plugin ensures tests with dependencies run in correct order

# Markers registration
markers =
    smoke: Mark test as smoke test (quick, critical functionality tests)
    regression: Mark test as regression test (comprehensive feature tests)
    slow: Mark test as slow running test
    flaky: Mark test as potentially unstable (requires retry logic)
    skip: Skip test unconditionally
    skipif: Skip test based on condition
    xfail: Mark test as expected to fail
    parametrize: Run test with multiple parameter sets
    dependency: Mark test dependencies for execution order
